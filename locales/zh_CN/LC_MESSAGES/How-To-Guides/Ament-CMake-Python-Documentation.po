"``ament_cmake_python`` is a package that provides CMake functions for "

"Pure Python packages should use the ``ament_python`` build type in most "
"cases. To create an ``ament_python`` package, see :doc:`Creating your "
"first ROS 2 package <../Tutorials/Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package>`. "
"``ament_cmake_python`` should only be used in cases where that is not "
"possible, like when mixing C/C++ and Python code."
