"Services are another method of communication for nodes in the ROS graph. "
"Services are based on a call-and-response model, versus topics’ "
"publisher-subscriber model. While topics allow nodes to subscribe to data"
" streams and get continual updates, services only provide data when they "
"are specifically called by a client."
