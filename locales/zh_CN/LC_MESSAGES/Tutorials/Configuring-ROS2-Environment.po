"ROS 2 relies on the notion of combining workspaces using the shell "
"environment. \"Workspace\" is a ROS term for the location on your system "
"where you're developing with ROS 2. The core ROS 2 workspace is called "
"the underlay. Subsequent local workspaces are called overlays. When "
"developing with ROS 2, you will typically have several workspaces active "
"concurrently."

msgid ""
"Combining workspaces makes developing against different versions of ROS "
"2, or against different sets of packages, easier. It also allows the "
"installation of several ROS 2 distributions (or “distros”, e.g. Dashing "
"and Eloquent) on the same computer and switching between them."
