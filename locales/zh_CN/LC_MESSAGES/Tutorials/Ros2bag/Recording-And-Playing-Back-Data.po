"``ros2 bag`` is a command line tool for recording data published on "
"topics in your system. It accumulates the data passed on any number of "
"topics and saves it in a database. You can then replay the data to "
"reproduce the results of your tests and experiments. Recording topics is "
"also a great way to share your work and allow others to recreate it."
