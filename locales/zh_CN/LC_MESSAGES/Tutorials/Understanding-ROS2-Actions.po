"Actions are one of the communication types in ROS 2 and are intended for "
"long running tasks. They consist of three parts: a goal, feedback, and a "
"result."

"Actions are built on topics and services. Their functionality is similar "

"Actions use a client-server model, similar to the publisher-subscriber "
"model (described in the :doc:`topics tutorial <./Topics/Understanding-"
"ROS2-Topics>`). An “action client” node sends a goal to an “action "
"server” node that acknowledges the goal and returns a stream of feedback "
