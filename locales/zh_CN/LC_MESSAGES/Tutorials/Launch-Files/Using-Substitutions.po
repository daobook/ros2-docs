"Launch files are used to start nodes, services and execute processes. "
"This set of actions may have arguments, which affect their behavior. "
"Substitutions can be used in arguments to provide more flexibility when "
"describing reusable launch files. Substitutions are variables that are "
"only evaluated during execution of the launch description and can be used"
" to acquire specific information like a launch configuration, an "
"environment variable, or to evaluate an arbitrary Python expression."
