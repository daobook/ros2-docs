"A workspace is a directory containing ROS 2 packages. Before using ROS 2,"
" it’s necessary to source your ROS 2 installation workspace in the "

"You also have the option of sourcing an “overlay” – a secondary workspace"

" your overlay will override packages in the underlay. It's also possible "
"to have several layers of underlays and overlays, with each successive "
"overlay using the packages of its parent underlays."
